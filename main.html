        College102 solves the problem of "What will my degree do for me"? After
        the pandemic, we at College102 noticed that a lot of educational goals
        were disrupted from covid-19. We want to change that. Our website allows

        for whatever major you are taking. Whether you are looking for a
        community, need guidance on your future, find the latest news in your

        it all for students who want an A in life.
