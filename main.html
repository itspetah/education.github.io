        College102 solves the problem of "What will my degree do for me"? After
        the pandemic, we at College102 noticed that a lot of educational goals
        were disrupted from covid-19. We want to change that. Our website allows
        you to type in your school and enter a personalized forum with the best
        tips, tricks, and student opinions on your major. In addition,
        College102 allows you to "pick" a roadmap and have a step-by-step plan
        for whatever major you are taking. Whether you are looking for a
        community, need guidance on your future, find the latest news in your
        field/school or are looking for challenging courses, College102 provides
        it all for students who want an A in life.
